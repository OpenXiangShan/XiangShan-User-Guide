# Bus Interface {#sec:bus-interface}

The bus interface of {{processor_name}} has a width of 256 bits and supports a
subset of AMBA CHI Issue B or Issue E.b. For detailed information about this
protocol, please refer to the AMBAÂ® CHI Architecture Specification.

## Supported Response Types

The RespErr in the CHI protocol can indicate either a normal or an error
response. The response types supported by {{processor_name}} are as follows.

| Value of RespErr | Response type          |
| :--------------: | ---------------------- |
|       0b00       | Normal Okay            |
|       0b01       | Exclusive Okay         |
|       0x11       | Non-data Error (NDERR) |

Since {{processor_name}} does not have data error checking codes, it does not
support DERR.

## Behavior under different bus responses.

* Normal Okay: Indicates successful normal transfer access or failed exclusive
  transfer access. A failed exclusive read transfer implies the bus does not
  support exclusive transfers, triggering an access error exception. A failed
  exclusive write transfer only indicates lock acquisition failure without
  raising an exception.
* Exclusive Okay: Exclusive access successful.
* NDERR: Access error, read transactions generate access error exceptions, write
  transactions ignore this error.

## Interface signals

CHI uses different channels to transmit various messages, including:

* Data (DAT)
* Request (REQ)
* Response (RSP)
* Snoop (SNP)

Channels prefixed with TX are for sending messages, while those prefixed with RX
are for receiving messages. {{processor_name}} has a total of 6 channels:

* RXDAT
* RXRSP
* RXSNP
* TXDAT
* TXREQ
* TXRSP

The signals included in these channels will be listed later. In addition to
these channels, the bus interface also includes the following signals.

| Signal Name          | I/O | Functional Description                                |
| -------------------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| chi_rx_linkactiveack | O   | Determines the state of RX.                           |
| chi_rx_linkactivereq | I   | Determines the state of RX.                           |
| chi_tx_linkactiveact | I   | Determines the state of TX.                           |
| chi_tx_linkactivereq | O   | Determines the state of TX.                           |
| chi_rxsactive        | I   | Indicates that there is an ongoing transaction in RX. |
| chi_txsactive        | O   | Indicates TX has ongoing transactions.                |

The state of RX is determined by linkactiveack and linkactivereq of RX; the
state of TX is determined by linkactiveack and linkactivereq of TX.
