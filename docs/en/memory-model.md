# Memory Model {#sec:memory-model}

## Overview of Memory Model

### Memory Attributes

The {{processor_name}} supports three types of memory: cacheable memory,
non-cacheable memory, and non-cacheable peripheral.

The physical memory attributes (Physical Memory Attributes) of an address are
defined by hardware and support the attributes specified in the RISC-V manual:

* R (Read Permission): Read permission
* W (Write Permission): Write permission
* X (Execute Permission): Execution permission
* A (Address matching mode): Address matching mode
* L (Lock Bit): Lock status

Additionally, {{processor_name}} supports the atomic (supporting atomic
instructions) and c (supporting cache) attributes.

### Memory Consistency Model

The cacheable memory adopts the RVWMO (RISC-V Weak Memory Ordering) memory
model. Under this model, the actual read/write order of memory among multiple
cores may not match the program-specified access sequence. Therefore, the RISC-V
instruction set architecture provides Fence instructions to ensure memory access
synchronization. Additionally, the RISC-V A extension includes LR/SC
instructions and AMO instructions for locking and atomic operations.

Both non-cacheable memory and non-cacheable peripheral memory types are strongly
ordered.

## Virtual memory management

### MMU Overview

The {{processor_name}} MMU (Memory Management Unit) supports RISC-V SV48 and
SV39 paging mechanisms. Its main functions include:

- Address translation: Converts virtual addresses (48 or 39 bits) to physical
  addresses (48 bits);
- Page protection: Checks the read/write/execute permissions of the page's
  accessors.
- Virtualization support: Enables two-stage address translation in a virtualized
  environment to convert guest virtual addresses to host physical addresses.
- Exception handling: Each module returns exceptions based on the request
  source.

### TLB Organization

The MMU primarily utilizes the TLB (Translation Look-aside Buffer) to implement
functions such as address translation. The TLB takes multiple virtual addresses
used by the CPU for memory access as input, checks the page attributes in the
TLB before conversion, and then outputs the physical address corresponding to
the virtual address.

The {{processor_name}} MMU employs a two-level TLB structure, with the first
level being L1 TLB, consisting of instruction ITLB and data DTLB, and the second
level being L2 TLB.

The configuration of L1 ITLB entries is as follows in the table.

| **项名** | **项数** | **组织结构** | **替换算法** | **存储内容** |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Page   | 48     | 全相联      | PLRU     | 全部大小页    |

The configuration of L1 DTLB entries is as follows in the table

| **项名** | **项数** | **组织结构** | **替换算法** | **存储内容** |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Page   | 48     | 全相联      | PLRU     | 全部大小页    |

For instruction fetch requests, load and store requests, when accessing the ITLB
and DTLB, if a hit occurs, the physical address and corresponding permission
attributes can be obtained in the next cycle.

The L2 TLB is shared by instructions and data, and the L2 TLB consists of six
main units:

1. Page Cache: Caches page tables. All four levels of the Sv48 page table are
   cached separately, enabling single-cycle querying of all four levels of
   information. Additionally, for virtualization requests, the Page Cache
   separately stores first-stage (va -> gpa) and second-stage (gpa -> hpa)
   requests, without directly storing va -> hpa mappings.
2. Page Table Walker: Queries the first two levels of page tables in memory;
3. Last Level Page Table Walker: Queries the last-level page table in memory;
4. Hypervisor Page Table Walker: Responsible for querying the second-stage page
   table translation.
5. Miss Queue: Handles miss requests from cache queries to Page Cache and Last
   Level Page Walker.
6. Prefetcher: A prefetch unit.

### Address translation process

The MMU is responsible for translating virtual addresses into physical addresses
and uses the translated physical addresses for memory access. {{processor_name}}
supports Sv39/Sv48 paging mechanisms, with virtual address lengths of 39/48
bits. The lower 12 bits are page offsets. For Sv39, the upper 27 bits are
divided into three segments (9 bits each), forming a three-level page table. For
Sv48, the upper 36 bits are divided into four segments (9 bits each), forming a
four-level page table.

The physical address of {{processor_name}} is 48 bits, with the structure of
virtual and physical addresses as shown in the diagram. Traversing the page
table requires four memory accesses, necessitating the use of TLB to cache the
page table.

![Sv38 Virtual Address Structure](figs/Sv39vaddr.svg)

![Sv48 Virtual Address Structure](figs/Sv48vaddr.png)

![Physical Address Structure](figs/paddr.png)

During address translation, instruction fetch at the frontend uses ITLB for
address translation, while memory access at the backend uses DTLB. If ITLB or
DTLB misses, a request is sent to L2 TLB via Repeater. Both frontend instruction
fetch and backend memory access employ non-blocking TLB access. If TLB returns a
miss, other requests can be rescheduled for query.

The page table of {{processor_name}} is used to store the entry addresses of
lower-level page tables or the physical information of final page tables. The
page table structure is shown in Figure 6.3:

![Page Table Structure](figs/pte.png)

{{processor_name}} Page Table Structure Bit Attributes:

**PBMT: Page-Based Memory Types**

The PBMT bit indicates the PMA attributes of the virtual address, with specific
definitions scenario-dependent, as illustrated. (Note: This feature requires
enabling the PBMTE bit in the menvcfg register.)

- PMA mode maintains compatibility with the original system attribute settings
  when virtual address PMA was undefined, adhering to the original physical
  address PMA attributes, i.e., the sysmap attributes;
- In NC mode, forcibly override non-cacheable, idempotent, and weakly ordered
  attributes, typically used for main memory;
- In IO mode, forcibly override non-cacheable, non-idempotent, and strongly
  ordered attributes, typically used for peripherals;
- When the PBMT bit is 3, it indicates a reserved mode, to be defined in the
  future.
- For PMA attributes not covered by SVPBMT, the original physical address's PMA
  takes precedence. For attributes that are forcibly overridden, PBMT takes
  precedence.

![Definition of PMBT](figs/pmbt.png)

**RSW: Reserved for use by Supervisor softWare**

Reserved page table attribute bits for privileged software, not processed by
hardware.

**D: Dirty bit: ** indicates whether the page has been written to since the D
bit was last cleared.

**A: Access bit:** indicates whether the page has been accessed (including
memory access and instruction fetch) since the A bit was last cleared.

**G: Global bit: ** indicates the page applies globally.

**U: User bit:** Indicates the page is dedicated to User mode.

**X: Executable bit:** indicates the page is executable.

**W: Writeable bit: ** indicates the page is writable.

**R: Readable bit: ** indicates the page is readable.

**V: Valid bit: ** indicates the page is valid.

{{processor_name}} supports the Svade extension. If a page is accessed (for
memory access or instruction fetch) without the A bit set, or written to without
the D bit set, a page fault will be triggered. It does not support the Svadu
extension and will not update the A/D bits in hardware.

The detailed process of address translation is described below, using Sv39 as an
example:

When the CPU accesses a virtual address, if the TLB hits, the physical address
and related attributes are directly obtained from the TLB. If the TLB misses,
the specific steps for address translation are as follows:

1. Obtain the L1 page table memory access address {SATP.PPN, VPN[2], 3’b0} based
   on SATP.PPN and VPN[2], then use this address to access the L2 Cache and
   retrieve the 64-bit L1 page table PTE;
2. Check if the PTE complies with PMP permissions. If not, generate the
   corresponding access fault exception; if compliant, determine whether the
   X/W/R bits meet the leaf page table conditions based on the rules. If they
   meet the leaf page table conditions, it indicates that the final physical
   address has been found, proceed to Step 3; if not, return to Step 1, replace
   satp.ppn with pte.ppn, change vpn to the next-level vpn, concatenate with
   3'b0, and continue the first step process;
3. Found the leaf page table, combined with the X/W/R/L bits in PMP and the
   X/W/R bits in PTE to obtain the minimum permissions for permission checking,
   and backfilled the PTE content into the L2 TLB.
4. At any step of the PMP check, if there is a permission violation, generate
   the corresponding access fault exception based on the access type;
5. If a leaf page table is obtained but: the access type violates the settings
   of A/D/X/W/R/U bits, a corresponding page fault exception is generated; if no
   leaf page table is obtained after three accesses, a corresponding page fault
   exception is generated; if an access fault response is received during the L2
   Cache access, a page fault exception is generated.
6. If a leaf page table is obtained but the number of accesses is fewer than 3,
   it indicates a large page table has been obtained. Check if the PPN of the
   large page table is aligned according to the page table size; if not aligned,
   a page fault exception is generated.

Additional note: {{processor_name}} does not allow access to page tables built
in MMIO address spaces. If during page table traversal, an address of a certain
level page table is found to be within MMIO space, an access fault exception
will be raised.

### Two-stage address translation for virtualization

{{processor_name}} supports the H extension. In non-virtualization mode and when
not executing virtualized memory access instructions, the address translation
process is largely consistent with that before the H extension was added. In
virtualization mode or when executing virtualized memory access instructions, it
is necessary to determine whether two-stage address translation is enabled.

The CPU enables two-stage translation based on vsatp and hgatp. The structure of
vsatp is shown in the following figure (SXLEN is fixed at 64 in
{{processor_name}})

![vsatp structure](figs/vsatp.png)

vsatp controls VS-stage translation. By default, vsatp remains enabled, meaning
VS-stage address translation is automatically activated during virtualization
mode or when executing virtualized memory access instructions.

hgatp controls G-stage translation. The structure of hgatp and its translation
mode are shown in the following diagram:

| **位**   | **域** | **描述**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [63:60] | MODE  | Indicates the address translation mode. When this field is 0, it is Bare mode, with no address translation or protection enabled. When the field is 8/9, it represents Sv39x4/Sv48x4 address translation modes. Any other value will trigger an illegal instruction fault. |
| [57:44] | VMID  | Virtual machine identifier. For the Sv39x4/Sv48x4 address translation modes adopted by {{processor_name}}, the maximum VMID length is 14                                                                                                                                   |
| [43:0]  | PPN   | Indicates the physical page number of the root page table for the second-stage translation, obtained by right-shifting the physical address by 12 bits.                                                                                                                    |

{{processor_name}} employs the Sv39x4/Sv48x4 paging mechanism, with the virtual
address structures of both mechanisms illustrated below.

![sv39x4 Virtual Address Structure](figs/sv39x4.svg)

![sv48x4 Virtual Address Structure](figs/sv48x4.png)

The VS-stage is responsible for translating guest virtual addresses into guest
physical addresses, while the G-stage translates guest physical addresses into
host physical addresses. The first-stage translation is essentially the same as
non-virtualized translation. The second-stage translation is performed in the
PTW and LLPTW modules, with the lookup logic as follows: first, search in the
Page Cache; if found, return to PTW or LLPTW; if not found, proceed to HPTW for
translation, which then returns and populates the Page Cache.

In two-stage address translation, the addresses obtained from the first stage of
translation (including the page table addresses calculated during the
translation process) are all guest physical addresses. These must undergo a
second stage of translation to obtain the actual physical addresses before
memory access can proceed to read the page tables. The logical translation
processes for Sv39x4 and Sv48x4 are illustrated in the figure below.

Sv39x4](figs/two-stage-translation-sv39-sv39x4.svg)

![Two-stage address translation with VS stage as Sv48 and G stage as
Sv48x4](figs/two-stage-translation-sv48-sv48x4.svg)

### System Control Register

**MMU Address Translation Register (SATP)**

The {{processor_name}} architecture supports an ASID (Address Space Identifier)
with a length of 16, stored in the SATP register. The format of the SATP
register is shown in the table.

| **位**   | **域** | **描述**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [63:60] | MODE  | Indicates the address translation mode. When this field is 0, it is Bare mode, with no address translation or protection enabled. When the field is 8/9, it represents Sv39/Sv48 address translation modes. Any other value will trigger an illegal instruction fault. |
| [59:44] | ASID  | Address Space Identifier. The length of ASID is configurable via parameters. For the Sv39/Sv48 address translation modes adopted by {{processor_name}}, the maximum ASID length is 16.                                                                                 |
| [43:0]  | PPN   | Represents the physical page number of the root page table, obtained by right-shifting the physical address by 12 bits.                                                                                                                                                |

In virtualization mode, SATP is replaced by the VSATP register, and the PPN
within it represents the guest physical page number of the guest root page table
rather than the actual physical address, requiring second-stage translation to
obtain the real physical address.

## Physical memory protection & physical address attributes

### PMP Overview

{{processor_name}} complies with the RISC-V standard. The PMP (Physical Memory
Protection) unit verifies access permissions for physical addresses, determining
whether the CPU has read/write/execute privileges for the address in the current
operating mode.

The PMA (Physical Memory Attributes) unit defines the attributes of physical
memory. It primarily specifies memory region types, defines memory access
characteristics, and controls memory access behavior.

PMA works in conjunction with PMP to jointly manage and control physical memory
access and attributes, ensuring system security and performance.

The design specifications of the {{processor_name}} PMP&PMA unit include:

- Supports physical address protection;
- Support for physical address attributes;
- Supports parallel execution checks for PMP & PMA;
- Supports distributed PMP and distributed PMA;
- Supports exception handling.

### PMP Control Register

The {{processor_name}} defaults to 16 PMP entries, which can be modified through
parameterization, employing a distributed replication implementation method.
Each PMP entry primarily consists of an 8-bit configuration register and a
64-bit address register, with no default initial values.

The address space of PMP registers is as follows in the table

| **PMP register name** | **地址** |
| --------------------- | ------ |
| pmpcfg0               | 0x3A0  |
| pmpcfg2               | 0x3A2  |
| pmpaddr0              | 0x3B0  |
| pmpaddr1              | 0x3B1  |
| pmpaddr2              | 0x3B2  |
| pmpaddr3              | 0x3B3  |
| pmpaddr4              | 0x3B4  |
| pmpaddr5              | 0x3B5  |
| pmpaddr6              | 0x3B6  |
| pmpaddr7              | 0x3B7  |
| pmpaddr8              | 0x3B8  |
| pmpaddr9              | 0x3B9  |
| pmpaddr10             | 0x3BA  |
| pmpaddr11             | 0x3BB  |
| pmpaddr12             | 0x3BC  |
| pmpaddr13             | 0x3BD  |
| pmpaddr14             | 0x3BE  |
| pmpaddr15             | 0x3BF  |

Among them, the layout of PMP configuration registers pmpcfg0 and pmpcfg2 is as
shown in the figure.

![PMP Address Register](figs/pmp.png)

The format of the PMP configuration register is as shown in the table below.

| **位** | **域**    | **描述**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7     | L        | Indicates whether the PMP entry is locked. This field defaults to 0, meaning unlocked; when set to 1, it indicates locked and requires a reset to unlock.                                                                               |
| [6:5] | Reserved | Reserved bits, default to 0                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [4:3] | A        | Indicates the address matching mode of this PMP entry. The default value is 0, meaning the PMP entry is disabled and does not match any address. Values 1, 2, and 3 represent TOR, NA4, and NAPOT address matching modes, respectively. |
| 2     | X        | Indicates whether the address configured in this PMP entry supports instruction execution. A value of 1 indicates execution support, while 0 indicates no execution support.                                                            |
| 1     | W        | Indicates whether the address configured in this PMP entry supports write operations. A value of 1 indicates write support, while 0 indicates no write support.                                                                         |
| 0     | R        | Indicates whether the address configured in this PMP entry supports read operations. A value of 1 means read is supported, while 0 means read is not supported.                                                                         |

The format of the PMP address register is shown in the following table.

| **位**   | **域**   | **描述**                                                     |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| [63:34] | 0       | The upper 30 bits of the PMP address register are 0        |
| [33:0]  | address | Stores bits [35:2] of the PMP entry configuration address. |

### PMA Attribute Register

The implementation of PMA adopts a method similar to PMP. PMA registers have
default initial values and must be manually configured to match the platform's
address attributes. PMA registers utilize the reserved CSR address space in
M-mode, defaulting to 16 entries.

The address space of PMA registers is shown in the following table

| **PMA register name** | **地址** | **reset value**      |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------------------- |

The layout of pmacfg0 and pmacfg2 is as shown in the figure.

## Exception Handling Mechanism

The {{processor_name}} MMU module may generate 4 types of exceptions, including
guest page fault, page fault, access fault, and ECC check errors in the L2 TLB
page cache. These are handled by corresponding modules based on the request
source.

The possible exceptions generated by MMU and their handling procedures are
listed in the following table

| **module** | **Possible Exceptions**         | ** processing flow **                                                                             |

Additionally, according to the RISC-V manual, Page Fault has higher priority
than Access Fault. However, if an Access Fault occurs during Page Table Walk due
to PMP or PMA checks, making the page table entry invalid, a special case arises
where both Page Fault and Access Fault occur simultaneously. In such cases,
{{processor_name}} chooses to report the Access Fault. In all other scenarios,
Page Fault maintains higher priority over Access Fault.

## Memory access sequence

In different scenarios, {{processor_name}} has different processes for accessing
address spaces, which can be briefly summarized as follows:

Scenario 1: CPU does not perform VA-PA translation

- The CPU needs to access PA;
- Look up address attributes;
- PMP 检查，确认地址读写执行权限；
- 执行地址访问。

Scenario 2: VA-PA translation in non-virtualized environment

- CPU attempts to access VA;
- Perform address translation via MMU to obtain the page table entry;
- 根据 PTE 查找地址、属性与权限信息；
- PMP 检查，确认地址读写执行权限；
- 执行地址访问。

Scenario 3: VA-PA translation in a virtualized environment

- The CPU needs to access guest VA;
- Check virtualization registers to confirm whether two-stage address
  translation is enabled.
- The MMU performs two-stage address translation to obtain the page table entry;
- 根据 PTE 查找地址、属性与权限信息；
- PMP 检查，确认地址读写执行权限；
- 执行地址访问。
